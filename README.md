The final deliverables include:

- A **two-page executive summary** highlighting key insights

- An **interactive Power BI dashboard** for financial exploration

- **Cleaned and categorised data**, fully processed using Python and Excel

## Project objective and research questions

The project wants to assess Emaar Properties’ financial health, growth potential, and investment outlook through a structured, data-driven approach. This project translates raw financial data into actionable insights and compelling visuals tailored to business decision-makers and finance professionals.

The analysis is structured around eight key investment questions:
1. Is Emaar growing?

2.  Emaar profitable?

3. How efficient is Emaar?

4. Is Emaar overleveraged?

5. How does Emaar's stock perform?

6. How volatile is Emaar’s stock?

7. Does Emaar generate enough cash?

8. Can Emaar sustain investments?

## Methodology
The analysis leverages Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements, drawing from audited financial reports and market data to build key financial metrics and visual narratives.

### ETL
ETL was handled entirely in Python, with the following steps:

**1. Data extraction:** Initial collection from Yahoo Finance; later replaced by official annual report data

**2.Data transformation:**
- Reshaping (wide to long format)

- Handling missing values

- Categorising line items (e.g., OpEx, CapEx, Financing Cash Flows)

- Standardising data types

**3. Validation:** Cross-checking extracted data with official 2021-2024 reports

In addition, preliminary financial graphs were generated using Matplotlib to explore main insights and trends before loading it into Power BI.

The cleaned data was then loaded into Power BI for dashboard creation and analysis.


## The Dashboard
The final dashboard presents key performance indicators and trend visuals, enabling interactive exploration across:
**- Revenue & Net Income Growth:** Signs of post-COVID recovery

**- Profitability Metrics:** Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA)

**- Free Cash Flow:** Stability and capacity for reinvestment

**- Debt Management:** Debt-to-Equity ratio over time

**- CapEx vs. Operating Cash Flow:** Sustainability of long-term investments
