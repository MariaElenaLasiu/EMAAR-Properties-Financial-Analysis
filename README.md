## Project objective and research questions

The goal of this project is to evaluate Emaar‚Äôs financial health, efficiency, risk exposure, and long-term investment potential through a structured, data-driven approach. The project translates raw financial statement data into actionable insights for executives, investors, and financial analysts.

The analysis is structured around eight key investment questions:
1. Is Emaar growing?

2.  Emaar profitable?

3. How efficient is Emaar?

4. Is Emaar overleveraged?

5. How does Emaar's stock perform? *(under development)*

6. How volatile is Emaar‚Äôs stock? *(under development)*

7. Does Emaar generate enough cash?

8. Can Emaar sustain investments?


## Methodology
This analysis is based on Emaar‚Äôs audited financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) from 2021 to 2024. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CAGR, ROE, ROA, FCF, and Interest Coverage were derived using Python, and validated manually with Excel.

The Power BI dashboard will be built to explore trends interactively and to support executive-level storytelling.

### ETL
ETL was handled entirely in Python, with the following steps:

**1. Data extraction:** Initial collection from Yahoo Finance; later replaced by official annual report data

**2. Data transformation:**
- Reshaping (wide to long format)

- Handling missing values

- Categorising line items (e.g., OpEx, CapEx, Financing Cash Flows)

- Standardising data types

**3. Validation:** Cross-checking extracted data with official 2021-2024 reports

In addition, preliminary financial graphs were generated using Matplotlib to explore main insights and trends before loading it into Power BI.

The cleaned data was then loaded into Power BI for dashboard creation and analysis.

**4. Pre-visualisation (Python):** 

- Preliminary trend graphs using Matplotlib

- Data exported to Power BI for dashboard development


## The Dashboard
The final dashboard presents key performance indicators and trend visuals, enabling interactive exploration across:
**- Revenue & Net Income Growth:** Signs of post-COVID recovery

**- Profitability Metrics:** ROE, ROA, Net Margins

**- Free Cash Flow:** Stability and capacity for reinvestment

**- Debt Management:** Debt-to-Equity ratio over time

**- CapEx vs. Operating Cash Flow:** Sustainability of long-term investments
